## POMODORA

### What is the pomodora technique?
***
The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the 
tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This project is built with python tkinter and widgets such as buttons, entries, labels and checkmarks
as one of my projects # (100 days of code). \
The whole project constitutes a canvas that displays  the graphical user interface of the pomodora app.
